description: Run one planning pass (update .wiggum/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md and .wiggum/TEST_PLAN.md)
---

Study `.wiggum/specs/*` and the repo code (do not assume missing).

Then update:
- `.wiggum/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` with a prioritized, actionable task list
- `.wiggum/TEST_PLAN.md` with a feature-based verification plan (favor automated tests; allow a small justified manual remainder)

Do not implement code. Use `.wiggum/AGENTS.md` and `.wiggum/config.json` to understand how the repo is run/tested.

Output should be:
1) a brief summary of the key gaps found
2) confirmation that the two files were updated
