description: Run one planning pass (update .wiggum/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md only)
---

Study `.wiggum/specs/*` and the repo code (do not assume missing). Then update `.wiggum/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` with a prioritized, actionable task list. Do not implement code. Use `.wiggum/AGENTS.md` to understand how the repo is run/tested.

Output should be:
1) a brief summary of the key gaps found
2) the updated plan file contents (written to `.wiggum/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`)
